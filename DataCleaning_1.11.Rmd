#### Jackson's Code

```{r}
# Read data 
data <- read.csv("ADS.csv")
```

```{r}
sum(is.na(data))

lab_cols <- colnames(data)[3:43]

# LOCF: If a subject has missing values in a column, the last observation recorded for that subject is used to fill in the following empty cells below it until a filled cell is encountered
# "filled" is the dataset with these imputed values 
filled <- data %>% 
  group_by(subjid) %>% 
  tidyr::fill(lab_cols, .direction = c("down"))

# Checking number of missing values after LOCF
sum(is.na(filled)) 

rowSums(is.na(filled)) # does not look too bad
mean(rowSums(is.na(filled))) # 13.3 missing values per row on average

# Number of values missing per row 
missing_per_row <- rowSums(is.na(filled))

# This outputs the average number of missing values per row for each subject 
average_missing_per_subjid <- filled %>% 
  cbind.data.frame(missing_per_row) %>% 
  group_by(subjid) %>% 
  summarise(avg_missing_per_subjid = mean(missing_per_row))

```

#### End of Jackson's Code 

#### Assessing First 11 columns (subjid to creatinine, inclusive)

```{r}
# Grace is assessing for outliers in columns 1 to 11 inclusive 
grace_df <- filled[, 1:11]

```

#### Plot of Missingness in Grace's variables 

```{r}
plot_missing(grace_df)
```

#### Histogram of variables 

```{r}
# Histogram of all variables 
plot_histogram(grace_df)
```

#### Age 

```{r}
summary(grace_df$Age) # values for age are normal (15 to 90)
```

#### ALP

```{r}
## Lab/Chemical/Enzyme values --------------------------
summary(grace_df$ALP) # Important part of liver function 

# Range: 12 - 2205 IU/L
# Missing values: 201410
# Normal healthy range: 44-147 IU/L 
# High ALP level: > 147 IU/L 
# Low ALP level: < 44 IU/L

# Since there were many individuals with an ALP in the 1000s includiing 2205, we will deem these values as expected since all individuals in this dataset were in the ICU 

boxplot(grace_df$ALP) # All outliers are in the 100s or 1000s

grace_df %>% filter(ALP == 2205) # This individual has multiple values of 2205 since we performed LOCF on all columns for which an individual had one or more values of a feature, but was missing values for the rows in the following time points  
```

#### ALT

```{r}
summary(grace_df$ALT) # Plays an important role in metabolism within the liver 

# Range: 1 - 11470 IU/L
# Missing values: 199864
# Normal healthy range of ALT is 0 - 40 IU/L

# Note: 
# Values of ALT above 1000 indicate critical health conditions like lack of blood flow to the liver or acute viral hepatitis 
# Values above 5000 are indicative of overdosing 

grace_df %>% filter(ALT == 11470)
# There is one individual who had a value of ALT of 11,470. We will deem this as an acceptable ALT value for our dataset since we are analyzing ICU patients who are in critical health condition

hist(grace_df$ALT)

boxplot(grace_df$ALT) # All outliers are above 1000 IU/L
```

#### AST

```{r}
summary(grace_df$AST) # AST is measured as a biomarker of liver function 

# Range: 4 - 18430 IU/L
# Missing values: 199703 
# Normal healthy range: 8 - 48 IU/L
# AST values > 40 IU/L may be a sign of liver inflammation and values > 1000 IU/L may be a sign of acute liver failure 

# Most of the outlying values of AST are above 1000 so we will deem these values as acceptable for our dataset
boxplot(grace_df$AST) 

```

#### BUN

```{r}
summary(grace_df$BUN) # Blood urea nitrogen - indication of kidney health

# Range: 0 - 197 
# Missing values: 46575 
# Normal healthy range: 6 - 20 mg/dL
# High levels of BUN (> 28 mg/dL) indicate that your kidneys aren't working well 

grace_df %>% filter(BUN == 0)

boxplot(grace_df$BUN) # Most outliers are above 50

# There are some values below 6 including 0 which may indicate very poor kidney health 

```

#### Bilirubiin

```{r}
summary(grace_df$Bilirubin) # Some research suggest that Bilirubin acts as a cellular antioxidant that may be particularly important in the brain 

# Range: 0.1 - 47.70 
# Missing values: 201113
# Normal healthy range: 0.3 - 1.0 mg/dL
# Any Bilirubin value > 1.2 mg/dL is usually considered elevated 

# High levels of Bilirubin are higher than 25 mg/dL

boxplot(grace_df$Bilirubin) # Most outliers are above 5 mg/dL and go until 47.70 mg/dL

```

#### Albumin

```{r}
summary(grace_df$Albumin) # Values for albumin levels appear normal 

# Range: 1 - 5.3 g/dL
# Missing values: 211632
# Normal healthy range: 3.4 - 5.4 d/dL

boxplot(grace_df$Albumin) # There are a handful of values just above and just below 5 g/dL and around 1 g/dL

```

#### Cholesterol

```{r}
summary(grace_df$Cholesterol) # Cholesterol levels appear normal, ranging from 28 to 330 mg/dL

# Range: 28 - 330 mg/dL
# Missing values: 283982
# Normal healthy range: 100 - 129 mg/dL
# Very high level: >= 190 mg/dL

grace_df %>% filter(Cholesterol == 330) # This individual likely has very high cholesterol 

boxplot(grace_df$Cholesterol) # The outliers of cholesterol are above 250 

```

#### Creatinine 

```{r}
summary(grace_df$Creatinine) # Serum Creatinine - important indicator of kidney health 

# Range: 0.1 - 22.10 
# Missing values: 
# Normal healthy range: 0.6 - 1.3 mg/dL
# Creatinine levels > 1.3 are considered high and may be a sign of poor kidney function 

grace_df %>% filter(Creatinine == 22.10) 

boxplot(grace_df$Creatinine) # Outliers are above ~ 3 mg/dL
```
