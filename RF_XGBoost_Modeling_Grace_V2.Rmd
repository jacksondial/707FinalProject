# (2) Subset train_data and test_data to just contain baseline characteristics collected at time of ICU admission (Age, Gender, Weight, Height, ICU Type, in_hosp_death) plus in_hosp_death

train_data_bl = train_data %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c("subjid")) %>% # remove subjid for modeling purposes 
  dplyr::select(Age, Gender, Height, ICUType, in_hosp_death)

test_data_bl = test_data %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c("subjid")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(Age, Gender, Height, ICUType, in_hosp_death)
```

### RF Modeling of Baseline Features

```{r}
# Classification Random Forest model using baseline features
set.seed(11022009)
rfm_bl = randomForest(in_hosp_death ~ ., data = train_data_bl, ntree = 500) 
print(rfm_bl)

```

The Random Forest model correctly predicts those who did not die at an accuracy of 0.38% and correctly predicts those who did die at an accuracy of 0.45.

#### Classification Accuracy of RF Model

```{r}
# Evaluate prediction accuracy
rfm_pred = predict(rfm_bl, test_data_bl)

# Build Confusion Matrix 
cfm = table(test_data_bl$in_hosp_death, rfm_pred, exclude = NULL)
cfm
# For patients who didn't die, 35014 of 41175 were correctly predicted to have not died. For those who did die, 621 of 41175 were correctly predicted to have died. 

# Classification accuracy 
classification_accuracy = sum(diag(cfm)/sum(cfm))
# The classification accuracy of the model is approximately 86.5%

```

The classification accuracy of the Random Forest model for in-hospital death is approximately 86.5% meaning that the model correctly classifies or predicts individuals as either a survivor or as dead.

#### AUC Curve

```{r}
# Compute AUC of RF Model
roc.test = roc(test_data_bl$in_hosp_death, as.numeric(rfm_pred))
rfm_auc = auc(roc.test) 

# Plot of Specificity vs. Sensitivity 
plot(roc.test)
```

The AUC of the Random Forest model is 0.546.

#### RF Variable Importance Plot

```{r}
# Create dataframe for variable importance plot 
var_importance = data_frame(variable = setdiff(colnames(train_data_bl), "in_hosp_death"), 
                            importance = as.vector(importance(rfm_bl)))

# Arrange Age, Gender, height and ICU type in order of most to lenast important  
var_importance = var_importance %>% 
  arrange(desc(importance)) 

# Make the variable in var_importance a factor for plotting purposes 
var_importance$variable = factor(var_importance$variable, 
                                 levels = var_importance$variable)

# RF Variable Importance plot 
p = ggplot(var_importance, aes(x=variable, weight=importance, fill=variable))
p = p + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Variable Importance from Random Forest of Baseline Features")
p = p + xlab("Demographic Attribute") + ylab("Variable Importance (Mean Decrease in Gini Index)")
p = p + scale_fill_discrete(name="Variable Name")
p + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
          axis.text.y=element_text(size=12),
          axis.title=element_text(size=16),
          plot.title=element_text(size=18),
          legend.title=element_text(size=16),
          legend.text=element_text(size=12)) 

```

Based on the importance plot above, Age has the largest decrease in the Gini index averaged over 500 trees, followed by Height. This indicates that Age and Height are the two largest contributors to the ability of the Random Forest model to predict in-hospital death.

### XG Boost Modeling of Baseline Features

```{r}
# Independent variables for train
X_train = data.matrix(train_data_bl[, -5])

# Dependent variable for train
y_train = as.numeric(as.character(train_data_bl[, 5])) # Must make the y_train a character and then numeric

# Independent variables for test
X_test = data.matrix(test_data_bl[, -5])

# Dependent variable for test
y_test = as.numeric(as.character(test_data_bl[, 5])) # Must make y_test a character and then numeric

# Convert the train and test data into xgboost matrix type 
xgboost_train = xgb.DMatrix(data = X_train, label = y_train)
xgboost_test = xgb.DMatrix(data = X_test, label = y_test)

set.seed(11022009) # using seed that Jackson used to generate training and testing data 

# XGBoost Model #
# Train an xgboost model using our training data - outputs training error
xgb_bl = xgboost(data = xgboost_train, # independent variables training data
                 eta = 1, 
                 max.depth = 4, 
                 nthread = 2, 
                 nrounds = 10, # Should this be increased or decreased ?
                 objective = "binary:logistic", # classification XGBoost
                 eval_metric = "auc") # AUC 


# Summary of XGBoost model
summary(xgb_bl) 

```

Based on the AUC values for each of the 10 rounds that the XGBoost model was ran, the AUC appears to increase quickly within the first 4 rounds after which it begins to slow down, reaching approximately 90% at round 10.

#### XGBoost Model Predictions

```{r}
# Use model to get predictions on test data in terms of probabilities 
pred_test = predict(xgb_bl, xgboost_test)

# Convert probability predictions to 0's and 1's
pred_y = as.numeric(pred_test > 0.5) # variable -- Any probability > 0.5 is classified as 1 and 0, otherwise 

# Confusion matrix -- need to convert y_test and pred_y to factors first
conf_mat = confusionMatrix(factor(y_test), factor(pred_y))
print(conf_mat)

```

#### AUC Curve

```{r}
# Calculate AUC and plot AUC curve for XGBoost 
roc.test = roc(test_data_bl$in_hosp_death, as.numeric(pred_y))
rfm_auc = auc(roc.test) 

# Plot of Specificity vs. Sensitivity 
plot(roc.test, colorize = TRUE, title = "AUC Curve of XGBoost Model")

```

The AUC of the XGBoost model is 0.5089 which is lower than the AUC of the RF model. Based on the AUC metric, Random Forest seems to perform better than XGBoost in predicting in-hospital death based on baseline characteristics Age, Gender, Height, and ICU Type.

#### XGBoost Variable Importance

```{r}
# Variable Importance Plot for XGBoost
importance_xgb = xgb.importance(colnames(xgboost_train), model = xgb_bl)
xgb_imp_plot = xgb.ggplot.importance(importance_xgb, top_n = 4) 
xgb_imp_plot + theme(legend.position = "none", 
          axis.text.y=element_text(size=12),
          axis.title=element_text(size=16),
          plot.title=element_text(size=18),
          legend.title=element_text(size=16),
          legend.text=element_text(size=12)) + 
  ggtitle("Feature Importance for XGBoost")

```

Based on the plot of feature importance above, Age is the largest contributor to the ability of the XGBoost model to predict in-hospital death followed by Height, ICUType and Gender. The results are consistent with the Random Forest model except that Gender follows farther behind in importance compared to in the Random Forest model. Age, Height, and ICUType are within a 0.1 difference in importance of each other while Gender has a difference of 0.2 in importance from ICUType.

```{r}
# Output importance matrix for XGBoost
print(importance_xgb)
```

The importance matrix of XGBoost above restates the results shown in the plot above which is that Age is the most important in predicting in-hospital death and Gender the least important.

#### Cross-Validation Results of XGBoost

```{r}
# Cross-Validation of XGBoost model 
xgb_cv = xgb.cv(data = xgboost_train, 
                 nfold = 5,
                 eta = 1, 
                 max.depth = 4, 
                 nthread = 2, 
                 nrounds = 10, 
                 objective = "binary:logistic", 
                 metrics = "auc",
                 prediction = TRUE)

# Print cross-validation results as data frame 
print(xgb_cv) 
```
